## Critical Deficiencies

No critical deficiencies identified.

## Recommendations

1. **Elaborate on Diagrams in Presentation:** The presentation should include diagrams for system architecture, data flow, etc.
2. **Iterate on LLM Prompts:** Dedicate effort during development to craft and test Claude prompts for optimal marketing content outputs.
3. **Confirm Mailchimp API Details for Presentation:** For discussing future live integration, ensure sufficient detail is gathered.

## Final Decision

* **READY FOR ARCHITECT** (Spirit of Decision)
