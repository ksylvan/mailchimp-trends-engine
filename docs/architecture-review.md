---

> Note: Most items are well-covered, with some areas noted as "partially covered" primarily because they are post-MVP concerns (like advanced monitoring, formal performance testing, detailed data retention policies, specific cloud IaC details) or where the current MVP plan is sufficient but could be elaborated post-MVP (like specific data migration tooling beyond `create_all`).
